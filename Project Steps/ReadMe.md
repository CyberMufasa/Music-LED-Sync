Project next steps:
- Log bin values to output file as signals are being read in
- use values to plot the frequency spectrum maybe in python
- Research hardware required to expand from single LEDs to LED strips
- Create document outlining the software metrics
  - the sample rate
  - lowest frequencies being used
  - highest frequencies being used
  - determine if filters should be used
