# Music-LED-Sync
Project aimed at syncing audio to an LED bank that changes color to music written in C using the Arduino ATmega 2560

Breaking it up into the following smaller Milestones:

1. - [ ] Create a single color LED based audio meter that changes brightness according to music or audio tones (like a dB meter on audio equipment that jumps)
2. - [ ] Modify the above meter to work with RGB LEDs where the color can shift to other solid colors or be in a rainbow configuration
3. - [ ] Look into amplifier design to boost the audio signals
4. - [ ] Add an LCD display to indicate the different modes like: color cycle, solid colors etc.
5. - [ ] Work on chassis design, or create the apparatus where it can be fitted to a guitar pedal
