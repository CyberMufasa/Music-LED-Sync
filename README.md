# Music-LED-Sync
Project aimed at syncing audio to an LED bank that changes color depending on TBD conditions

Breaking it up into the following smaller Milestones:

1. Create an single color LED based audio meter that changes according to music or audio tones (like a dB meter on audio equipment that jumps)
2. Modify the above meter project to work with RGB leds where the color can shift to other solid colors or be in a rainbow arrangement
3. Look into amplifier design to boost the audio signals
4. Add an LCD display to indicate the different modes like: color cycle, solid colors etc
5. Work on chassis design, or create the apparatus where it can be fitted to a guitar pedal
